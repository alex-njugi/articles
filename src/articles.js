**A Message to Whoever Listens**

**John 2:19**

> *"Jesus answered them, ‘Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.’”*

**How unfortunate it is that they didn’t realize He was speaking of His own body, soon to become the new temple. And yet, their anger makes me wonder: why were they so offended by His words?**

The countrymen of Jesus were fuming angry at Him. Why were they angry? Because Jesus said, "Destroy this temple." What is so special about the temple? Every Jew took pride in three things. Three things that they held dear to them. First, the king. Second, the land. Third, the temple. Every Jew was proud of these three things. The king, the land, the temple.

Why were the Jews angry when Jesus said, "Destroy this temple?" Because at that time, the land was occupied by the Romans and their kingdom had been divided. And therefore, they had only one reason for being proud, the temple. "And our one reason for being proud, the temple, you are going to destroy?" That made them very angry. In fact, during the trial of Jesus, it would be one of the charges brought against Him. He said, "Destroy this temple."

Now, what is this saying to us? Before you judge the Jews, for being so unreasonable, I will ask you: What do you do when something very precious to you is removed from you? What will you do when somebody tells you that something very priceless, very dear to you, "I will destroy it, I will feed it to the flames, I will burn it, it will be taken from you" what do you do? And then you will understand why the Jews were angry. Because the temple was very precious to them. The temple had their gold. The temple had their precious stones. The temple had their love. The temple had their devotion. And these will be destroyed. This precious building will be destroyed. Our pride will be destroyed.

Now, my dear brothers and sisters, it is good to be reminded today that everything you love will be taken away from you. Everybody you love will be taken away from you. Everything, everybody you hold dear and very precious will be removed from you. Why? There is only one answer. Why will all these things very dear to me be removed from me? Why will all these things very precious to me be removed from me? Why? For only one answer: **They are not God.** They are not God and therefore, they will be removed from us. Because at the end of it all, only God will remain with us. Because when things become too special for us, and we hold on to them very tightly, or we cling to them very tightly, they actually become our gods. That is why they need to be removed. Because when we cling to them very tightly, they become our idols.

The temple of Jerusalem remains destroyed until now. And our own little temples, if not yet destroyed now, will soon be destroyed. Your parents whom you cannot live without, this job, this house and land that I worked so hard for, this car that I paid for, this house, this health that I take care of, this name that I take care of, we hold on to so many things. And I say it again, my dear brothers and sisters: if you cling too tightly, they will become idols, and that is idolatry. If you hold on too tightly, they will become your gods, more important than God.

**But the beautiful thing, my dear brothers and sisters, is this: once they have been destroyed, once they have been taken away from us, they will return to us in a new form.**  The dignity is gone, the good name is gone, the friendship is gone, my spouse betrayed me, my mother and father died, all this has been taken away from you. But they return to us in a new form. And this time, they return to our lives brought back by God. And when God brings them, persons and things back to us, they return to us differently, because we now see them as less precious than God. We place things and people in the right place. They return to us in away that glorifies the lord.

My dear brothers and sisters, the temples you hold dear will soon be destroyed. Do not be angry. Accept it. It is true. And everything, everything will be taken away from you because they are not God. And when everything is taken away from us, only one will remain. Our solid bedrock, and that is the Lord. And so when this time comes, do not be blinded, be strong and seek Him.

And now we understand, we have not lost anything. We have not lost anyone. It is the Lord who is with us. Destroy this temple. Destroy everything precious. Destroy everybody dear. They are not gods. But keep in mind: everything will be destroyed except the Lord. And it is the Lord who will return everything destroyed and give us a new beginning, a new life, a new heaven, a new earth.
